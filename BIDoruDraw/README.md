I reused followed code (mostly copy paste) regarding Swing and timers:

 * http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/guidebook/?name=JPanel&page=1
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)#A_basic_example
 
Code of the GUI looks like a mess, but I never did anything in Swing and didn't  really wanted to spend time on exploring it.... But I may fix it one day ;)
